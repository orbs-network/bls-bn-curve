    // know individal and public key. When a threshold amount of group members agree to sign on
    // the same message then then anyone can combine the signatures into a single
    // signature that can be verified against the groups public key
    //
    // The result of dkg be 1) each member will generate a secret key used to
    // sign messages for the group. 2) a group verification vector which contains
    // the groups public key as well as the the information need to derive any
    // of the members public key.
    //
    // Overview
    // 1) Each member will "setup" and generate a verification vector and secret
    // key contrubution share for every other member
    // 2) Each member post their verifcation vector publicly
    // 3) Each member sends their key contrubution share each other member
    // 4) When a member recieves a contrubution share it validates it against
    // the senders verifcation vector and saves it
    // 5) After members receive all thier contribution shares they compute
    // their secret key for the group
